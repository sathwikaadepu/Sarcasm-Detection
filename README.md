# Sarcasm-Detection
# Multi-model Ensemble based Sarcasm Detection Framework on Social Media Platform
## Overview
Welcome to the Sarcasm Detection Project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting sarcasm in textual data. Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that often conveys the opposite of its literal meaning, making it a fascinating and complex linguistic phenomenon. The ability to automatically identify sarcasm has practical applications in natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
## Features
* **Data Collection:** The project includes a dataset carefully curated for sarcasm detection, containing a diverse range of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive into the dataset through EDA to gain insights into the distribution of sarcastic and non-sarcastic instances, explore key features, and understand the linguistic nuances of sarcasm.

* **Preprocessing:** Implement robust text preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the data for model training.

* **Model Development:** Build and fine-tune machine learning models, such as natural language processing (NLP) models or deep learning models, to effectively identify sarcasm in text.

* **Evaluation Metrics:** Implement metrics to evaluate the performance of the sarcasm detection model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

* **Model Interpretability:** Explore methods to interpret model predictions and gain insights into the features that contribute to sarcasm detection.
